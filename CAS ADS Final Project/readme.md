# Final Project 

The CAS Project yields 4 ECTS points (~120 hours workload) and is a data science project on data of your choice. The deliverable is a report with supporting notebooks. The project should have its github respository, for example the one that was created for Module 4. You can and are encouraged to work in teams. The project report is typically between 10 and 20 pages. Your work can be a consolidation of things you have done during the CAS, e.g. and extension of your Module 1 CDR or a new project on a new dataset

## Summary of the project: 
This project aims to investigate the centralization of hospital services and regional strategies within the healthcare sector in Switzerland. Using quantitative methods and machine learning models on publicly available hospital data, the analysis seeks to predict the opening and closing of hospital locations based on local economic and political data. The results reveal that the models employed did not outperform random chance in predicting these events. Challenges such as data imbalance and limitations in data quality were identified, emphasizing the need for refined approaches and more comprehensive datasets. The forthcoming dataset from the Swiss Federal Statistical Office (FSO) is expected to address some of these limitations and enable more accurate analysis. Future work will involve further refining the analysis framework, exploring alternative techniques, and incorporating additional variables for enhanced predictions and understanding of regional hospital strategies.
