# Final Project 

The CAS Project yields 4 ECTS points (~120 hours workload) and is a data science project on data of your choice. The deliverable is a report with supporting notebooks. The project should have its github respository, for example the one that was created for Module 4. You can and are encouraged to work in teams. The project report is typically between 10 and 20 pages. Your work can be a consolidation of things you have done during the CAS, e.g. and extension of your Module 1 CDR or a new project on a new dataset
