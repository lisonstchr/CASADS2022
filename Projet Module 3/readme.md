# Project Module 3
This folder contains the project for the Module 3 of the CAS in Applied Data Science of the University of Bern.  

The learning outcomes for Module 3 are: 
1. Overview of machine learning pipelines and their implementation with scikit-learn
2. Regression and Classification: linear models and logistic regression
3. Decision trees & random forest models
4. Principal component analysis (PCA) and non-linear embeddings (t-SNE and UMAP)
5. Clustering with K-means and Gaussian mixtures
6. Artificial Neural networks as general fitters, fully connected nets used to classify the fashion-MNIST dataset
7. Scikit-learn and clustering maps, Q&A

In this project, we used a dataset from the National Swiss Council to try predict councilor's votes based on type of voting object and councilor's individual characteristics. 
The data was retrieved using the API of the Swiss Parliamentary Services. 
After retrieving the data, we did some descriptive statistics and implemented different machine learning model for our predictions. 

The folders contains: 
1. CADADS_M3_dataset_Kim.ipynb, a python file created by Kim Lan Vu to retrieve and shape the data. 
2. CAS_ADS_M3_Dataset.csv, a csv file of the dataset. 
3. CASADS_M3_DescriptiveStatistics_Lisa.ipynb, a python file created by Lisa Asticher that contains the descriptive statistics about the dataset. 
4. CASADS_M3_MachineLearningAlgorithms_Emilie.ipynb, a python file created by Emilie Zuchinetti that contains the machine learning models. 
5. WebServices_Anleitung_kurz.docx, which is the manual provided by the Swiss Parliamentary Services to help retrieve the data from the API and with the help of the Swiss Parliamentary's Python packages.
